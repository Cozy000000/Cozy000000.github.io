<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Zhiyi Chen** (陈志屹), an Undergraduate Student. candidate in Artificial Intelligence Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Under the guidance of [Prof. Zeyi Wen](https://zeyiwen.github.io/). My research interests are in the fields of NLP, efficient large language models, HPO, and machine learning.


<!-- **Research Interests**

My research focuses on enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of deep learning models, particularly in the following areas:

- Model Compression: Exploring pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation techniques to reduce model size and computational demands.
- Efficient Large Language Models: Optimizing LLM training and inference through innovative architectures and deployment strategies.
- Automated Machine Learning (AutoML): Developing methods to streamline the ML pipeline, from architecture search to hyperparameter optimization.

My goal is to contribute significantly to the development of more efficient and accessible machine learning systems. Through my research, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible in model compression, efficient large language models, and automated machine learning. If you share similar interests or would like to discuss potential collaborations, I warmly invite you to reach out to me. I'm always eager to connect with fellow researchers and industry professionals to exchange ideas and explore new opportunities in this exciting field. -->
